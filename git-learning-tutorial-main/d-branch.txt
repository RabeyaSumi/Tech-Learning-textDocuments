-Branch: After oppening a repository from github origin, leftside of repository name branches shows as dropdown list.
    We will learn about branch with our another repository "localRepository" 
    which fetched up git repository is "takeLocal".
    We have two empty files in this repository "index.html" and "style.css".

    -Command to check branches.
        git branch
    This command output is 
        *master

-Rename Branch: 
    -Command to rename a current branch.
        git branch -m newBranchName
        git branch -m main
    Now my current branch name is 'main'

-Create new branch: When we create another branch another branch get a copy of the current branch.
    -Command to create a new branch.
        git checkout -b newBranchName
        git checkout -b feature1      (newly created another branch)

    Now I have two branches
    -Command to check branches.
        *feature1
        main
    Now we have two branches, and current branch is '*' marked feature1. When we create branch we also checkout from another branch.
    
    Note: Now we have same two branch with all files. Then we can add files or content to the seperate branch seperately.

-Checkout to another branch: To go to another branch we need to checkout from current branch.
    -Command to go to another branch.
        git checkout newBranchName
        git checkout main

    Now we are in main branch.

-Delete branch: Before delete a branch we need to go to another branch. We are currently on main branch.
    Now we can delete feature1.
    
    -Command to delete a branch.
        git branch -d branchName
        git branch -d feature1
    Now we have only branch which is the main branch.

    So, for the further work I am creating the branch again by the command "git checkout -b newBranchName".
