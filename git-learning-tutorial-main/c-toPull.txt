-Pull: In github/remote repository, I have added this file "c-toPull.txt" with this pull description.
  -Need to do command "git status" to check local repository's current status.
  -This command output is:
    Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 2 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
          (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

  Which mean remote repository's content need to pull into local repository.

  -Command to pull content from remote repository.
        git pull

  Then local repo shows file "c-toPull.txt".
