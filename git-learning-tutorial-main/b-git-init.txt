-Git initialize: Firstly we need to create a folder to our local computer. My folder name is 
    "localRepository" which I have created in "Git Learning Documentation" folder. In this folder we will
     initialize git. 

    -Command to initialize git control to a folder.
        git init

    Now this is our git repository. In "Git Learning Documentation" we have two git repository.
        git-learning-tutorial
        localRepository
    

-Add origin: Our newly initialized git repository "localRepository" don't have a connected git origin repository.
   
    -Command to add/connect a remote repository.
        git remote add origin https://github.com/RabeyaSumi/takeLocal.git             (by remote repo link)

-Check origin:

    -Command to check remote origin.
        git remote -v

    Now we will see our remotely connected 'fetched' origin link where we can 'push' our work.
    This command output is -
        origin  https://github.com/RabeyaSumi/takeLocal (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/RabeyaSumi/takeLocal (push)

-Add files: Add and push two files "index.html" and "style.css" to this repository. We need to follow command from "a-status.txt" file.


-Note: Now We have two git repository in our computer local folder "Git Learning Documentation".
     (1)  git-learning-tutorial
     (2)  localRepository
    We have two remote origin repository fetched/connected with them.
