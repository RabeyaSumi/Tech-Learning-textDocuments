-Push: Our localRepository has two files index.html and style.css. 
    I have added a paragraph <p>This is new html file</p> in index.html.
    Before push content firstly we need to add and commit. 

    -Command to push to origin.
        git push origin branchName
        git push origin main
    
-Upstream branch: From the current branch if we always want to push to a branch we can make that branch upstream branch.
    -Command to make a branch upstream.
        git push -u origin branchName
        git push -u origin main
    Now branch main set as a upstream branch.
    Next time I just need to type command.
        git push
    And also for pull just need to command.
        git pull
