-Merging branch: We have two branch "main" and "feature1" in our repository. When we are working with push and Pull
        we added contents to the main branch what we don't have in our feature1 branch.

        We are currently in main branch. As main branch ahead of the feature1 branch, 
        we need to checkout to feature1 by the command "git checkout feature1".
        
        -Command to merge two branch.
            git merge anotherBranchName          (anotherBranchName is the branch which we want to merge to our current branch)
            git merge main

        Now main branch and feature1 have the same content and feature1 need to push in origin feature1 branch.

-Merging confliction: When two branch have same content but content changed in some portion. Then merging confliction occur.
        If merging confliction occur we get some resoving messages to the file editor. We need to resolve confliction on hand on the editor file.
        Then our current branch get the merge file how we want it, then we need to checkout to another branch. Then we can merge two branch without confliction.
